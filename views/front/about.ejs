      <h3>Recording and transmission of film</h3>
      <p>
        The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes
        with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature
        models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and
        computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these
        techniques, and other visual effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images
        were recorded on a strip of chemically sensitized celluloid
        (photographic film stock), usually at the rate of 24 frames per second.
        The images are transmitted through a movie projector at the same rate as
        they were recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that each frame remains
        still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes
        stroboscopic intervals of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the
        interruptions due to flicker fusion. The apparent motion on the screen
        is the result of the fact that the visual sense cannot discern the
        individual images at high speeds, so the impressions of the images blend
        with the dark intervals and are thus linked together to produce the
        illusion of one moving image. An analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic
        recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds) runs along a
        portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and was not projected.

      <h3>Etymology</h3>
      <p>
        The name "film" originally referred to the thin layer of photochemical
        emulsion[2] on the celluloid strip that used to be the actual medium for
        recording and displaying motion pictures.

        Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including
        picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most
        common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is
        preferred. Archaic terms include "animated pictures" and "animated
        photography".
      </p>
      <p>
        Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver
        screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is commonly used, as
        an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early
        years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.

      <h3>First motion pictures</h3>
      <p>
        By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid
        photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which
        could photograph a rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed
        action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film.
      </p>
      <p>
        Movies were initially shown publicly to one person at a time through
        "peep show" devices such as the Electrotachyscope, Kinetoscope and the
        Mutoscope. Not much later, exhibitors managed to project films on large
        screens for theatre audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were
        made in 1895 by the American Woodville Latham and his sons, using films
        produced by their Eidoloscope company,[3] and by the arguably better
        known French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière with ten of their own
        productions.[citation needed] Private screenings had preceded these by
        several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumière brothers'.
